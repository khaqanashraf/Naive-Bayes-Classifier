# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Here is the statistical implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier written in Kotlin. It is binary classifier to distinguish between two classes as Positive or Negative class. It calculates the likely hood of each class and compare them to determine estimated class. This simple yet useful Classifier can be used to solve many Text Classification Problems for example The Federalist Papers Problem. The Bayes Classifier uses probabilistic approach for estimation.
